# README

Greetings my friend! You visited the repository, where we are working on a wonderful project that will allow you to monitor and manage events in your city.

The project is under development and we are working hard to deploy the first version of the site.

* Ruby version 2.4.1

* Database creation
  The project comes without a `database.yml` file, so you have to create it yourself.
